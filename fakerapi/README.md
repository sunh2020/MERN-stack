# Faker API

This is using Express, Nodemon and Postman.

Using Express: npm install

Add express on your server.js > const app = express();

Open terminal > node server.js or just down load Nodemon globally > npm install -g nodemon

Now you can use nodemon server.js to open terminal (start terminal)



# Do you want to create a fake person's name and address?

# Do you want to create a fake company name and address?

to start server - nodemon server.js

and open your Postman app

You will choose workspace and GET request

You need to add a correct URL for each GET request from Postman
 
URL > http://localhost:8000/api/users/new   >   to see a fake person

URL > http://localhost:8000/api/companies/new   > to see a fake company

URL > http://localhost:8000/api/user/company   > to see a fake person with company
